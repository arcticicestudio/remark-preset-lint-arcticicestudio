</ul>
<p><strong>All pull requests must be send against the <code>develop</code> branch</strong> - Please read the <a href="#branch-organization">branch organization</a> section below for details about the branching model.</p>
<h3 id="documentations">Documentations</h3>
<p><em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em>&apos;s documentation consists of guides, which helps users to learn about the project, and the project docs, which serves as a reference.</p>
<p>You can help improve the docs and guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, bringing them up to date when there are differences to the latest version. This can be done by submitting a <a href="#enhancement-suggestions">enhancement suggestion</a> and then opening a <a href="#pull-requests">pull request</a> for it.</p>
<h2 id="branch-organization">Branch Organization</h2>
<p>The <em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em> uses the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model" target="_blank">gitflow</a> branching model. The repository consists of two core branches with an infinite development lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>master</code> - The source code of <code>HEAD</code> always reflects a tagged release version.</li>
<li><code>develop</code> - The default branch where the source code of <code>HEAD</code> always reflects a state with the latest development state.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All <a href="#pull-requests">pull requests</a> for the limited development lifecycle <em>story</em>/<em>topic</em> branches must be send against the <code>develop</code> branch</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-else-can-i-help">How else can I help?</h2>
<h3 id="improve-issues">Improve Issues</h3>
<p>Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. You can help to make it easier for maintainer to understand and resolve them faster. since handling issues takes a lot of time that could rather spend on writing code.</p>
<h3 id="give-feedback-on-issues-and-pull-requests">Give Feedback On Issues and Pull Requests</h3>
<p>We&apos;re always looking for more opinions on discussions in issues and pull request reviews which is a good opportunity to influence the future direction of <em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/remark-preset-lint-arcticicestudio/labels/question" target="_blank">question</a> issue label is a good place to find ongoing discussions and questions.</p>
<h2 id="styleguides">Styleguides</h2>
<p>Every major open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards and conventions for the writing and design of code, documentations and Git commit messages. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.</p>
<p>A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community. It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.</p>
<h3 id="markdown-code-style">Markdown Code Style</h3>
<p>This project is a implementation of the <a href="https://arcticicestudio.github.io/styleguide-markdown" target="_blank">Arctic Ice Studio Markdown Style Guide</a> and, of course, adheres to its rules.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-markdown" target="_blank"><img src="https://rawgit.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-markdown/develop/assets/styleguide-markdown-banner-typography-badge.svg" width="40%"></a></p>
<h3 id="javascript-code-style">JavaScript Code Style</h3>
<p>All JavaScript source of <em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em> adhere to the <a href="https://arcticicestudio.github.io/styleguide-javascript" target="_blank">Arctic Ice Studio JavaScript Style Guide</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-javascript" target="_blank"><img src="https://rawgit.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-javascript/develop/assets/styleguide-javascript-banner-typography-badge.svg" alt="Arctic Ice Studio JavaScript Style Guide Badge"></a></p>
<h3 id="git-commit-messages">Git Commit Messages</h3>
<p>A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate <em>context</em> about a change to the maintainers. The code will tell what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell why. Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can&apos;t avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em> adheres to the <a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-git" target="_blank">Arctic Ice Studio Git Style Guide</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-git" target="_blank"><img src="https://rawgit.com/arcticicestudio/styleguide-git/develop/src/assets/styleguide-git-banner-typography-badge.svg" alt="Arctic Ice Studio Git Style Guide Badge"></a></p>
<p>The style guide assumes that you are familiar with the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model" target="_blank">gitflow</a> branching model.</p>
<h2 id="mcve">MCVE</h2>
<p>A Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example.</p>
<p>When <a href="#bug-reports">reporting a bug</a>, somtimes even when <a href="#enhancement-suggestions">suggestig a enhancement</a>, the issue can be processed faster if you provide code for reproduction. That code should be&#x2026;</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x2026;Minimal &#x2013; Use as little code as possible that still produces the same behavior</li>
<li>&#x2026;Complete &#x2013; Provide all parts needed to reproduce the behavior</li>
<li>&#x2026;Verifiable &#x2013; Test the code you&apos;re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>A MCVE is a common practice like on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and sometimes it is also called <a href="http://sscce.org" target="_blank">SSCCE</a>, a <em>Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example</em>.</p>
<p>The recommended way for GitHub based projects is to create it as <a href="https://gist.github.com" target="_blank">Gist</a> or new repository, but of course you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests" target="_blank">attach it to issues and pull requests as files</a>, use any free code paste- or file hosting service or paste the code in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax" target="_blank">Markdown code blocks</a> into the issue.</p>
<h3 id="minimal">Minimal</h3>
<p>The more code there is to go through, the less likely developers can understand your enhancement or find the bug. Streamline your example in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restart from scratch</strong>. Create new code, adding in only what is needed to demonstrate the behavior and is also useful if you can&apos;t post the original code publicly for legal or ethical reasons.</li>
<li><strong>Divide and conquer</strong>. When you have a small amount of code, but the source of the bug is entirely unclear, start removing code a bit at a time until the problem disappears &#x2013; then add the last part back and document this behavior to help developers to trace- and debug faster.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="minimal-and-readable">Minimal and readable</h4>
<p>Minimal does not mean terse &#x2013; don&apos;t sacrifice communication to brevity. Use consistent naming and indentation following the <a href="#styleguides">styleguide</a>, and include comments if needed to explain portions of the code.</p>
<h3 id="complete">Complete</h3>
<p>Make sure all resources and code necessary to reproduce the behavior is included. The problem might not be in the part you suspect it is, but another part entirely.</p>
<h3 id="verifiable">Verifiable</h3>
<p>To entirely understand your enhancement or bug report, developers will need to verify that it <em>exists</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow the contribution guidelines regarding the description and details</strong>. Without information developers won&apos;t be able to understand and reproduce the behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate any issues that aren&apos;t relevant</strong>. Ensure that there are no compile-time errors.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure that the example actually reproduces the problem</strong>. Sometimes the bug gets fixed inadvertently or unconsciously while composing the example or does not occur when running on fresh machine environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p><em>Arctic Ice Studio remark-lint Preset</em> follows the <a href="http://semver.org" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning Specification</a> (SemVer). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for enhancements like new features and improvements, and major versions for any backwards incompatible changes. Deprecation warnings are introduced for breaking changes in a minor version so that users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.</p>
<p>Every significant change is documented in the <a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio/remark-preset-lint-arcticicestudio/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
